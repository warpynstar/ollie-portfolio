                <br>This painting is dedicated to Emma.
                <br>Emma was a dear childhood friend of mine, and she was diagnosed with cancer when we were in middle school. Her battle was long, but she never failed to keep her goofy and energetic personality about her. Near the end of her time during hospice, we spent time doing simple arts and crafts. We made these air- dry clay figurines together a week before she passed.
                <br>
                <br>Peace out, Em.
            </p>
